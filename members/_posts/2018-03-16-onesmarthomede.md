I started with smart home / home automation in 2010 while renovating our old 60s house. In 2016 I started a german tutorial blog onesmarthome.de to help people set up openHAB 2. 

Because of my blog I came in contact with a pro hockey player who got ALS. I helped him build connect a speech recogonition to his KNX installation. We got friends and started a project to help people get an easier life with smart home technology. Now we have a non profit organization MyFreeLife e.V. where MyFreeHome.de is a part of. 

Helping people who realy need smart home technology is our passion.
