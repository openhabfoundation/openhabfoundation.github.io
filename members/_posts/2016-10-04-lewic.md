The Lewi Cleantech GmbH is a child of digitization and the Internet of Things with customers in the B2B and B2C.

Our priorities are smart energy management and individual integration of bus systems in the private and industrial environments.

Data acquisition and processing in graphics and charts creates transparency and facilitates your decisions. Event Management reduces downtime and remote operations are saving time that you do not have to be suburban. Smart user interfaces bring convenience and also a lot of fun.

Eclipse SmartHome and OpneHAB are our most important tools to bring together together many smart island solutions and to connect to an integrated system. Eclipse SmartHome and OpneHAB are for us depending on the task, the Swiss army knife, the glue or the bridge between the many, sometimes even very proprietary manufacturer systems.

With our company's own developer skills, we combine and connect existing previous and new systems. If necessary, we program custom interfaces to your existing systems and devices and make them smart.

For planning and implementation we are thinking in 20 year periods, because it is important for us to design solid, durable and low-maintenance systems for your individually needs.

Your smart world connectors from Lewi Cleantech.
