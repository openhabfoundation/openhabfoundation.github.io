		<p>The current smarthome market suffers under the commercial interests and competition of big companies, which are fighting for customers and trying to push their proprietary ecosystems. This leads to a highly fragmented market with vendor lock-ins, making interoperability and extensibility a big challenge.</p>
		
		<p>We believe that smart homes must not be closed or restricted, but that everyone should have the freedom to extend, modify and enhance it.</p>

		<p>The openHAB Foundation e.V. was founded to boost innovation and to make open-source smart home technology easily available for everybody.</p>
		<p>Our members support this idea and specifically believe that <a href="http://www.openhab.org/">openHAB</a> has the potential to be a leading open-source smart home solution that is worth to be supported to build a counterweight to proprietary and closed solutions.</p>
