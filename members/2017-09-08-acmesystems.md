In Acme Systems srl we design and build Linux embedded modules 
for OEM purposes since 2005.

Starting from this year (2017) we are developing application board 
based on the new Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3 to provide professional
and long term duration hardware to the widely popular software available
for Raspberry Pi boards.
