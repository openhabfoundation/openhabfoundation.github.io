The current smarthome market suffers under the commercial interests and competition of big companies, which are fighting for customers and trying to push their proprietary ecosystems. This leads to a highly fragmented market with vendor lock-ins, making interoperability and extensibility a big challenge.

We believe that smart homes must not be closed or restricted, but that everyone should have the freedom to extend, modify and enhance it.

The openHAB Foundation e.V. was founded to boost innovation and to make open-source smart home technology easily available for everybody.
Our members support this idea and specifically believe that [openHAB](https://www.openhab.org/) has the potential to be a leading open-source smart home solution that is worth to be supported to build a counterweight to proprietary and closed solutions.
