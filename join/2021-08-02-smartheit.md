smartheit offers profesional KNX programming services and uses openHAB for advanced Smart Home projects.

<!-- more -->

The philosophy of smartheit is to provide vendor neutral Smart Home technologies which will exist also in the future.
We also believe that data recorded by a smart house belongs to the customer and only to the customer.
To achieve these goals only a vendor neutral and open Smart Home framework can be used.
This is why we chose openHAB.
