	<p><i>Inventory Data:</i></p>

	<p>When signing up for myopenHAB, we collect and use personal information from you, which we need for the smooth operation of the service. These are in particular:
	<ul>
		<li> Your e-mail address to identify you and contact you for relevant information about the myopenHAB service</li>
		<li> The UUID and the secret of your openHAB instance in order to identify your personal instance</li>
		<li> The device IDs of smart phones, which are connected to myopenHAB to identify them for sending push notifications</li>
	</ul>

	<p><i>Usage Data:</i></p>

	<p>While using myopenHAB, your openHAB instance transfers data to the myopenHAB service. All data related to remote access (from web UIs or the REST API) to the openHAB instance is transported through myopenHAB but NOT stored. Only regular server log files are kept with the request meta-data like timestamps, IP addresses, request URLs, etc. This data is used for performance analysis and to ensure system integrity.
	The following data, which is not related to remote access but to other myopenHAB services, IS stored:</p>
	<ul>
		<li> Online / Offline events, which can be viewed at https://myopenhab.org/events</li>
		<li> Sent push notifications can be viewed at https://myopenhab.org/notifications</li>
		<li> Item events, according to your settings in the "expose" configuration property - here you can define yourself which information is transmitted. This information is only shared with third parties with your explicit consent. This is for example the case when using the IFTTT integration, since you have to grant IFTTT access to your data. The approval of the access by other services to your data can be revoked at any time by deleting the OAuth2 entry.</li>
